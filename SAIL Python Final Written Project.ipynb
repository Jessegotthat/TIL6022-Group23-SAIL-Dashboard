    "SAIL Amsterdam 2025 was a major city event where over 10,000 vessels from around the world were showcased around the north of Amsterdam Centraal station. The event attracted a major crowd, with over 2.3 million visitors congregating in one location during the week. Since the event brought an irregular surge in human traffic flow to the entirety of Amsterdam, there is demand by the event organizers and revelent stakeholders for a dashboard allowing both monitoring and predicting current and future traffic flow around the city to ensure public safety and aid in important decision making by the end users. Hence for this project, the following main objective was identified:\n",

    "To develop a working final product with proper insights into current and future crowd flow, the group has integrated several different data sets connecting to SAIL 2025 pedestrian traffic. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Datasets (Sensor Data)\n",
    "The main datasets which this project will depend on concerns the data gathered by each sensor. The neccessary data is spit into two sets, with the first csv file containing the main pedestrian traffic flow information, with a count of people at each sensor location scattered around the city given every 3 minutes. This dataset provides the group with the base variables for this model. The second excel dataset contains the sensor's metadata, which includes each sensor's base ID, name, width and geographic coordinates. This data will be utilized to understand the specs of the sensor and to map the findings from the previous count data onto a potential dashboard presentation, allowing the end user to easily understand the pedestrian data through a map overlay. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Inputs\n",
    "- Part 2: Independent Variables which we will plug in for future projection and modelling (Needs to be finished)\n",
    "\n",
    "While predictions can be produced with just the base sensor data, it is hypothesized that there are more external variables that influence pedestrian flow than just the time of the day when the count was made. Especially for a major event like SAIL, several different factors is expected to occur during the event which can alter traffic. To properly visualize these variables to the best of our ability to make our projections accurate, this group has also utilized additional data sets which will act as our independent variables to observe its influence it has on our sensor data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**TomTom Traffic (roads).**  \n",
    "The first external dataset is the TomTom Traffic dataset. It is provided as a CSV with a `time` column and, for each timestamp, a nested micro-CSV that lists pairs of `(road_segment_id, traffic_level)`. With the NWB roads shapefile, we parse these records into per-timestamp road-segment values and then aggregate them to a 3-minute grid. For modeling, we derive indicators such as the mean congestion level, variance (dispersion across segments), and the 95th percentile (extreme congestion). These aggregated indicators are aligned with the pedestrian sensors in time and are also used in lagged form to capture the leading effect that road conditions can have on subsequent crowd flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vessel Positions (ships).**  \n",
    "The Vessel Positions dataset provides the change in ship coordinate data in a time stamp form (timestamps e.g., `update-time` / `upload-timestamp`; coordinates: `lat`, `lon`), indicating which ship was located where in a given time, and ship attributes (e.g., `speed-in-centimeters-per-second`, `short-term-avg-speed-in-cm-per-sec`, `length`, `beam`, `type`). For efficiency we use a pre-aggregated parquet built from the raw CSV: at a 3-minute cadence we compute the total vessel count and average speed (low speeds are a proxy for docking/boarding/exhibiting). This data was determined useful for our model, as it is hypothesized that certain ships may attract viewers more than others, creating a potential difference in crowd formations for each boat. By understanding these ship locations as well as its potential popularity and project it against our geographic sensor data, it will allow the model to factor in these differences in inducing foot traffic for each vessel, potentially improving our final predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "To answer the subquestion, several different multi score mobility datasets were integrated to potentially find refined patterns between these data sets, which may allow the predictive model to produce accurate future projections that takes in as many variables connected to the pedestrian traffic at the venue as possible."

    "### Predictive Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to utilize the dataset and predict future pedestrian flow, there is a need to implement a fitting predictive model. Initially, the group was given a choice between either **XGBoost** or **LightGBM**. For this model, the group has chosen to use **XGBoost**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rationale for XGBoost\n",
    "Firstly, the group has identified that XGBoost works well with the data amount this group possesses. This is because there is a total of 4 days of data (around 2400 rows), which is a reletively small sample. XGBoost's regularization knobs (min_child_weight, gamma, reg_alpha, reg_lambda) therefore helps prevent overfitting its algorithm when sample sizes are limited, while also being faster to produce a robust baseline than LightGBM. XGBoost also supports count targets, allowing the group to start with producing normal regressions and utilize Tweedie or Poisson if needed. XGBoost is also found to be presentation friendly with SHAP visualizations percisely explaining the prediction rational and backtesting making the reporting easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Revisit LightGBM\n",
    "In comparison, LightGBM maybe more useful if the model contains data spanning a longer time period (over 2-4 weeks) or if its richer exogenous features (especially when factoring in weather or vessel schedules) fits well with any additional variables we may plug into the model. In this scenario, LightGBM's speed with more expansive featres becomes more advantageous, and is best to revisit this method if the variables become further expansive.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Road traffic level (`traffic_level_mean`) vs human_flow:** **clear negative** correlation.  \n",
    " In our TomTom data, `traffic_level` is treated as a **relative speed index** (≈ current speed / free-flow speed, range ~0–1). **Higher `traffic_level` indicates smoother roads (less congestion); lower `traffic_level` indicates heavier congestion.** This is defined by the services offered by TomTom([Traffic Flow Service](https://developer.tomtom.com/traffic-api/documentation/tomtom-orbis-maps/traffic-flow/traffic-flow-service)).\n",
    " Thus, **heavier congestion (lower level)** aligns with **higher pedestrian flow**, while **free-flowing roads (higher level)** align with **lower flow**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Average vessel speed (`vessel_avg_speed`) vs human_flow:** **moderate negative** correlation.  \n",
    "  Lower average speed (loitering, docking, exhibitions) aligns with more people on the quays.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vessel count (`vessel_count`) vs human_flow:** **small positive** correlation.  \n",
    "  More active vessels in the area coincide with slightly higher pedestrian volumes.\n",

    "- **Change in traffic level (`traffic_level_chg`) vs human_flow:** **small positive** correlation.  \n",
    "  This is the **first difference** of `traffic_level_mean` (current minus previous step). Short-term improvements in road conditions tend to align with increases in pedestrian flow, but the effect is mild at 0-lag.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the **same timestamp**, road congestion (level), vessel behavior (speed), and activity (count) are all informative, with the **strongest signal** coming from `traffic_level_mean`.\n",

    "**B. Structure among driver variables (collinearity clues)**\n",

The lead–lag curve is monotonic without a distinct peak, indicating a **persistent correlation** between traffic conditions and crowd movement rather than a single best lead time. The negative relationship becomes more pronounced when the lag is positive, but a clear correlation is also observed when the lag is negative.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### 1) When surrounding roads start **clogging**\n",
    "When TomTom road data shows that nearby traffic is slowing down, crowd levels along the waterfront usually **increase within 15–30 minutes**.  \n",
    "This means that road congestion is an **early signal** of crowd build-up.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**What to do:**\n",
    "- Use this early warning to **prepare crowd control** before the peak arrives — deploy extra stewards, open more walking routes, and adjust soft barriers.\n",
    "- Redirect visitors through **clear signage or announcements**, guiding them toward less crowded viewing points.\n",
    "- In high-risk locations such as **bridges or narrow streets**, temporarily switch to **one-way walking** to avoid jams.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:**  \n",
    "When car traffic slows down, it often means more people are arriving or moving on foot toward the waterfront, especially during large public events.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2) When **vessel activity rises** but **average speed drops**\n",
    "When the number of ships in the monitored area increases and their average speed decreases, it usually means ships are **docking, showing, or boarding passengers** — moments that attract people to gather nearby.  \n",
    "Crowds often build up **shortly after** these signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to do:**\n",
    "- Prepare **observation areas** near the berths where popular ships are docking.\n",
    "- Deploy stewards to **separate queues from walking paths**, keeping flows moving along the promenade.\n",
    "- Communicate early: “Plenty of space at East Quay” or “View also available from Pier 3”.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:**  \n",
    "Vessel movements act as a **live indicator** of where people will gather next — slower, denser marine activity usually predicts a rise in nearby pedestrian density.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3) When both signals appear together\n",
    "If roads are congested **and** vessel activity increases at the same time, it is a **strong warning** that crowd pressure will rise soon.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended response:**\n",
    "- Open additional pathways or crossings to spread the flow.\n",
    "- Bring in **reserve teams** to manage the crowd.\n",
    "- Begin **guiding or slowing the inflow of visitors** about 10–15 minutes **earlier** than usual to prevent sudden crowding.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4) Summary for daily operations\n",
    "- Road and vessel data can act as **early-warning tools** for on-site teams.  \n",
    "- Use them not just for reporting, but for **timely coordination** — who to send, where to guide, and when to act.\n",
    "- Combine these signals with on-site observation (CCTV, radio) to confirm and fine-tune responses.\n",
